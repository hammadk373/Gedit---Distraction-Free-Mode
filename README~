This is simple plugin for gedit 3.x that provides a distraction free setting similar to the one provded by sublime text editor.

Widescreen monitors are far from ideal for writing text with the editor maximized to full screen. With editor places in only part of the screen the background also provides a distraction.

On activation the text is moved into a 600px column in the middle of the screen, which is ideal for writing on most monitor
