This is simple plugin for gedit 3.x that provides a distraction free setting similar to the one provded by sublime text editor.

Widescreen monitors are far from ideal for writing, with the editor maximized to full screen. With editor places in only part of the screen the background provides a distraction.

On activation of this plugin, the text is moved into a 600px column in the middle of the screen, which is ideal for writing on most monitor that i have tested. Using this plugin along with white text on a dark background and the gedit set in fullscreen mode gives the best results.

To install copy the .plugin and .py files to ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/ distectory(create the dir if it does not exsist) and restart gedit. activate from Edit > preference > plugins. A new button is created on the toolbar for toggling the mode.
