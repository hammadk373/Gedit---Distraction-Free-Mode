This is simple plugin for gedit 3.x that provides a distraction free setting similar to the one provded by sublime text editor(http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

Widescreen monitors are far from ideal for writing with the editor maximized to full screen. With editor placed in only part of the screen the background provides a distraction.

On activation of this plugin, the text is moved into a 600px column in the middle of the screen, which is ideal for writing on most monitor that i have tested. Using this plugin along with white text on a dark background and the gedit set in fullscreen mode gives the best results.

To install copy the .plugin and .py files to ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/ directory(create the dir if it does not exist) and restart gedit. activate from Edit > preference > plugins. A new button is created on the toolbar for toggling the mode.
